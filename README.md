# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis-in-Jupyter
This project is a Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of a booking dataset of two hotels that are City hotel and Resort hotel. This dataset contains 119390 Rows and 32 Columns. And 31994 dublicate rows so after removing all duplicate rows the shape of dataset became 87396 rows & 32 columns. The null values are in some columns like country,company,agent and children so i filled null/missing values by 'other' for country column and by 'zero' for remaining ones.

The data types of columns are object,int64,float64. I added two new columns named 'total people' by adding adult,children and babbies column data and second column is 'total_stay' by adding stays_in_weekend_nights and stays_in_week_nights.
